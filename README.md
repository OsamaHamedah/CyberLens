# CyberLens
This is the main repository for my graduation project "CyberLens"

The landscape of cybersecurity is characterized by rapid evolution where hackers strike continuously, and new vulnerabilities show up daily, which make relaying on static documentation as we see in the traditional educational recourses a weak method to face these threats and attacks, rather than creating a gap between theoretical knowledge and real-time threat intelligence.

This project, “Cyber Lens” addresses this gap through developing a dynamic community-driven threat intelligence platform. Unlike passive static e-learning websites. Cyber Lens integrates real-time data streams via CVEdetails.com API in order to provide live statistics on vulnerability prevalence & severity. The platform empowers IT students & cyber enthusiasts to move from the static environment to an active dynamic space through three cores which are 1. Interactive Analysis. 2. Real-Time Intelligence. 3. Community Collaboration.
The Interactive Analysis is maintained through “Kali GPT” AI to simplify complexity, Real-Time Intelligence by offering a live dashboard of the current trend of global cyber threats, & Community collaboration by allowing the users to publish research, engage in discussions, and validate findings using IEEE reference standards.

Combining live data visualization, AI assistance, & community collaboration, Cyber Lens creates a perfect dynamic zone for IT students & cybersecurity enthusiasts.
